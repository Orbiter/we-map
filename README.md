# WeeMap

This is a map where you can add markers to remember and share locations. 

## Functions: 
- Click on the map to add a location (blue marker). 
- Right-click on a marker to remove it. 
- Click on a marker to show its comment. 
- Click on the comment to edit it. 

All markers are stored in the URL of the page!

## You can share the URL with others to collaborate with the markers: 
- Copy the URL with the "Share" button. 
- Export all markers with the "Export" button into a text file.

## You can also search for locations: 
- Click on the "Search" button and enter a location name. 
- Results are only searched within the visible view box! 
- Click on a search result location (green marker) to view the location name. 
- To convert a search result marker (green) into a normal, stored marker (blue), right-click on it.
